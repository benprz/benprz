## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 23 years old student at 42Lyon since 2019, searching for my next professionnal experience in any fields to broaden my qualifications and validate my [RNCP 7 "Expert in Computer Architecture"](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/36137/) (equivalent Master II degree) with a specialization in "Operating systems and network".
